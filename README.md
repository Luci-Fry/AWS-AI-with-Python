# AI Programming with Python Project

This is the capstone project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program provided by Amazon Web Services. 

In this project, an image classifier was built with PyTorch, and then converted into a command line application. The classifier is used to predict the name of the flower in an image of it. The confidence of the model prediction (probability) is also displayed. 

The application allows a user to specify the pre-trained model (vgg19 or densenet121) to use for the development of their model and indicate whether or not to use GPU for training by using arguments in the command line.
