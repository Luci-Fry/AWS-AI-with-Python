# AI Programming with Python Project

This is a project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 

In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The flower images for training, testing and validation can be found in the `flower_data.tar.gz` file.
